1. An idea without the execution worths zero penny 2. No one knows whether a idea will work or not. If someone is saying to you, this idea isnâ€™t going to work, they are lying. Because no one has a crystal ball to predict your idea will work or not, until they start doing it. So screw them
3. Stop finding excuses, if u want something bad u will fight everything to make it happen.
