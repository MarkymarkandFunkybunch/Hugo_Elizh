1. An idea without the execution worths zero penny /  No one knows whether a idea will work or not. If someone is saying to you, this idea isn’t going to work, they are lying. Because no one has a crystal ball to predict your idea will work or not, until they start doing it. So screw them / Stop finding excuses, if u want something bad u will fight everything to make it happen. 

2. Us military makes a clear distinction between risk and uncertainty, whereas risks are threats can be identified or at least can be mitigated, while uncertainty applies to unknown or ambiguous risk that resist any application of probability theory or quants method. Know what u know but also expect the unexpected!  # What is Risk? 

3. When plague broke out in ancient Athens, it enabled Sparta, which was more disciplined, to become dominant”. No prize guessing, as China seeks to emerge from coronavirus lockdown, who might be Sparta this time. # Covid-19 

4. Opportunities & Hopes revives among the crisis, Wwen mount tambora erupted in April 1815 the dust and ash from the volcano in what is now Indonesia blotted out the sun and lowered global temperatures, hurting harvests everywhere. As food prices soared, tens of thousands of people died from famine and disease. So did thousands of horses, because their owners could no longer afford to feed them oats. It was against this dismal backdrop that Karl von Drais, a German inventor, dreamed up the Laufmaschine to replace equine locomotion.

5. Results tend to be non-linear. Or: nothing nothing nothing nothing nothing nothing nothing nothing nothing nothing nothing HUGE IMPROVEMENT. But the HUGE IMPROVEMENT isn’t possible without all the nothing’s beforehand.

6. Know your customers/your audience, understand their needs/purpose; understand your need/your purpose; Use the straight line method to bring the conversation back on the track when it deviates.Try to be a good listener and summarise what your audience says before you speak.

7. Neural network is very similar to how a human brain will work. It is very probabilistic but with contextual relevance. Google acquire deep mind several years ago, it operates as the semi - independent subsidiary of Google. What makes deep mind unique is that deep mind absolutely focus on creating digital super intelligence , Or AI that is vastly smarter than any human on earth and smarter than all humans combined. Deep mind AI has administer level access to google ‘s servers to optimize the energy usage at data centre. However, this could be an unintentional trojan horse. Deep mind have complete control of data centre so with little software update, by all means they have complete control over your data. That means they can do anything, they can look at all your data and do anything. We are rapidly head towards digital super intelligence that far exceeds any human.  If AI has a goal and humanity just happen to in the way, it will destroy the humanity as a matter of course without even thinking about it, no hard feeling. Just like us, if we are building a road, an ant hill happens to in the way, we don’t hate ants, we are just building the roads, so goodbye ant hill. It is important AI not to be other, it has to be us.
