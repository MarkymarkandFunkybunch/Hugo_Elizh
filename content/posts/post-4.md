## **What is an LIC?** ## 


An LIC (listed investment company) is an investment vehicle that provides access to a diversified portfolio similar to what an ETF does. Most of the LICs listed in the ASX. These types of managed funds give investors instant portfolio diversity handled by a professional fund manager.

When the price of a certain stock (one that’s also included in the LIC portfolio) falls below the NTA (net tangible asset), it can be a signal to get into an LIC. This is because you’ll be buying at a discount to get a basket of different stocks compared to acquiring them separately on the exchange. With that said, owning a LICs is equivalently to expose to a basket of shares. If you already have 20 top stocks in your portfolio and there is no point adding another likewise companies in.


However, buying at an NTA discount doesn’t guarantee higher returns according to historical statistics.


## **Difference between ETF and LICs?** ##
Investors often get confused between ETFs and managed funds, so what exactly is the different between them? 

ETF as an open-end fund, it typically experiences huge sell-off when market is under short selling attack or downtrend pressure. In contrast, LICs are close ended, so they don’t experience this problem. Think about this, market is suffering from temporary drop down at the same time investors get panic and start making redemption from ETF, which forces ETF fund managers to sell their positions at unreasonable prices.

On the other side, LICs don’t have to sell strong stocks in order to compensate money withdrawn by leaving investors. In other words. LIC could protect investors benefits and implemented their strategies properly as they have no exposure to fire redemption. Moreover, LICs distributed the fully franked dividend to investors.  

## **How should investors screen LICs?** ## 
Research shows investors are better off selecting recently underperformed LICs, which might sound bit irrational. Investors normally eye on buying outperform is because the it berated market by 30% last year, but truth is you shouldn’t do that because to buy some fund managers is being underperformed is discovered to be more profitable than outperform as the mean reversion. 

Another reason, investors might want to avoid something that has high dividend yield as we want to investigate if dividend is stable and consistent OR if they have enough reserve to keep paying out all those dividend.

Moreover, investor might want to avoid big LICs as following reasons: (* Big in terms of market caps)

a.	They are more passive than average 
b.	 Historically speaking, big LICs trade at discount at the expensive market, but they tend to be traded at premium when market falls 

## **Should you by discounted LICs or the LICs with premium?** ## 

LICs are typically either traded with discount or with premiums, that means traded price is either below or above their net tangible asset value. Therefore, market has been debating about both bearish and bullish views for long time.

LICs bear claimed that those larger discounts could be permanent as investors nowadays favour exchange traded fund. In other words, market starts losing faith for fund managers and believed they will be outperformed by index fund. The reality also echoes the result, showing that 95% of LICs invest in Australia share market failed to outperformance similar ETFs. 

Meanwhile LICs bulls argue that many LICs are trading at discount to its net tangible asset well beyond their long-term average. Based on mean reversion theory, discount or premium will all covert back to median discount or premium over time.

While research reveals among last four years premium and discount fluctuates around 6-8 %; normalising the premium will add much extra 3-4 % per annum.

## **Summing up** ## 
Overall speaking, LICs will be more attractive to investors who have little exposure to the market while also have faith that discount will revert to median over long term.
