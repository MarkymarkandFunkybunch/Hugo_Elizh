The first swap you’ll want to do with your weight loss diet is to stick mostly with minimally-processed foods. Not only are these less processed foods beneficial when dieting in the sense that they generally provide more nutrients and keep us fuller for longer, but they also have another benefit that has to do with something called the thermic effect of food, which is the amount of calories that our body burns to metabolize and actually use the foods that we ingest. And one of the unique fat loss benefits about unprocessed foods is that in most cases our body burns significantly more calories when digesting unprocessed foods than it does when compared to their processed counterparts. So, you can further influence the “calories out” side of the equation and potentially speed up the fat loss process by simply swapping these foods for whole grain, less processed foods instead.
