GOLD / XAUUSD
Gold was up 23 pips on Thursday at the time of writing trading at around 1727.49
The US continues its “whatever it takes” tone, indicating the ongoing aggressive monetary policy 
towards economy supporting. Words from Powell, “We are not even thinking about raising rates” 
still fail to eliminate the concerns/doubts of second wave of infections, pushing investors back onto 
safe havens thus trending yellow metal.  
Long term low interest rate and loose monetary policies nudge investors the compelling reason of 
investing gold -- inflation hedge.  Investors therefore take a detour and decide to put more weights 
upon gold compared to interest-earning assets into their portfolio.
Given on “getting nothing from holding the US dollar until 2022”, that might be a well-diversified 
move to dump several dollars into Gold.
