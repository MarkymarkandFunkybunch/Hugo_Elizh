## What does PE tell you? 

PE could be interpreted in the following ways:

1.	Famous saying “good company bad stock”, higher PE reflects investors’ confidence and market sentiment. In other words, market and investors like those stocks or anticipate future growth if company has a high PE.

2.	It also means “If you buy a stock, how long It takes you to earn you money back.” Try to think in this way, assume you buy the stock with 193 PE, it is equivalently meaning you are paying $193 for its current $1 earnings per share which indicates that takes company 193 years to earn you money back. However, this statement assumes earnings stay the same all time while Nanosonics is predicted to witness exponential earning growth.

3.	PE is a relative multiple and investors will be better off comparing it within peers and industries before label them overvalued or undervalued.	
 
## Should you worry too much about the high PE? 

Without doubt, earnings have significant impact on PE multiple as only news or company announcement is considered to move price in the short term. That said, increasing earning (as denominator increases) will lower the PE and makes it look less expensive. In other words, investors are optimistic and confident enough about company’s future earnings. For example, lots of tech or healthcare companies looks expensive even with no or little earning on the paper since investors are paying now for the future growth.  

More specifically, once those high PE companies start controlling their expense and generating profits, their PE won’t look expensive anymore.

As for Nanosonics’ case, analysts predict approximately 4.8 times earning per share growth in next three years. In other words, the whole (what do u mean by whole PE) PE  will decrease by 4.8 times to around 40 PE since earning as the denominator increased by 4.8 times. 

## Impeccable balance sheet deserves high PE?

Analysts continues to be optimistic about NAN’s future growth in regard to revenue, net income and earning. revenue, net income and earnings are estimated to ramp up by 131time, 33 times and 4. 8 times respectively over next three years. Such tremendous growth forecast is undoubtably a shot in the arm for investment in NAN.

More surprisingly, growth is achieved with low financial leverage. Simultaneously, the operating cash flow to total debt is around 9.5 times also suggests NAN’s strong debt servicing ability with only cash payment.

## What about dividend?

There is no point leave dividend off the table when we discuss about earning since companies normally pay their dividends out of their earnings. It is reasonable to predict dividend will become unsustainable if a company is paying more than it earns. With only 2 cent earning per share, it is understandable that NAN’s priority is to reinvest all those capital for further expansion and pays no dividend at this stage.

## Conclusion

NAN’s impeccable balance sheet offers investors an undeniable reason to buy. Before investors stringent their punter, it is worthwhile to noticing 193 times PE multiple although It has potential to be lowered below industry average after three years.
