The glimpse of the Startup Financial modelling:



## Always start with Why? ## 

A financial modelling is an tangible tool to justify or visualise your assumption/hypothesis (for example, your cash burn rate, your repeat rate your LTV..)
Therefore, the physical figures could be a light bulb moment 💡 for you in regards to how realistic your goals were, so that you could in control and be capable to flip it.


Engineer/marketing team, revving up your engine, metal under the tension. Finance team’s job is to keep the business off the highway, the danger zone⚠️.

## How do you start build a customised financial modelling? ## 

Other than above reason, we also expect the financial modelling be a storyteller to your potential investors, VC/Crowdfunding resources
So, what story are you telling? Show them on the paper📄!  

Stand on the giants ‘shoulder. There are different templates online, feel free to grab them and customise one for your own.

Input your facts/ tractions so fat
Don't be scared, this is the time to unveil the mysteries behind the scheme. 

KISS: keep it stupid simple ; You are using the financial model to tell a story with simple numbers not to throw jargon and stand out.
 	
 Components in the financial modelling: 

**Expense**💸
Personally, i advocate startup be bit _conservative_ about their expense to prepare for the rainy days. Especially during this period, the importance of the 5% tail risk cant seem to be emphasised enough more.

Start with the _easy_ part - Salaries and the wages 👷 where you have full control over what you spend and who you are hire.

Other Fixed business expense include advertising/Insurance/Office expense/Rent 

**Revenue** 📈
Here is where you stand on the stage and start telling your story:
Tell your audience/ investors about what you think about the business 

_What is your target customers?_ 

_How do you price your product?_ 

Refer to YC graph below, the optimal price will be right between value and cost.

 What happened normally: price too low; underestimate the cost; customers don't understand your value.
 
 Or it is very likely you are focusing on wrong customers. I will leave this to you guys…

Starting with your existing traction and then push your historical performance forward along with your foreseeable improvements. If you don't have traction yet, you are more welcome to borrow benchmarks from your peers who already have one. 

If there is no such peer, you probably whet appetite 😋 from VCs / investors already and you should put it on the front page before anything else.


## Metrics ##

PAD CAC: cost per customer acquired through paid marketing channels.

Retention rate: how sticky is your product 

LTV: Lifetime value: How much will they spend on your platform?

MRR: revenue recognised for recurring services  

Gross MRR churn: should pay attention to someone stops using it 
 (details & explanation in Appendix) 

Why does investors care about those metrics, not only because metrics tell startup’s potentials & plans directly but also demonstrate its implicit ROI. 

## Scenario analysis / Sensitivity analysis ## 

Sensitivity analysis determines how target variables are affected based on changes in other variables known as input variables.

Investors understand things never follow the plan, as 💩 happens . Therefore, they keen to understand how well startup is capable of coping / handling pressure when scenarios change.  

For example, what if the receivable turnover / Payable turnover varies, or cash burn rate surges… By implementing different scenarios analysis demonstrates your risk management skills.

Appendix: 

Various Startup should focus on different metrics:

SaaS
Metric:  MRR/APP/GrossMRR 
Common mistakes: Classify non recurring/non recurring payment as the revenue.

Subscription:  ( SaaS sell the software / services to companies, while subscription structures as users pay fees for the access to the services) 

Gross MRR churn:
And so this is why  we recommend measuring something called Gross MRR Churn, which is say at the start of  the month, you expected your monthly recurring revenue to be 10,000 but one customer churn  and they were paying 3,000 then that's your gross churn, 3,000 by 10,000. So don’t blend it, because you're obviously acquiring new users and if you measure blended, your numbers  still look great, right? Because you're growing a lot, but you're not paying attention to  users that you're losing. And it's really important to learn from users you're losing, which  is why we ask you to measure the churn
