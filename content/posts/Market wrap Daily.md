Market wrap up:


## 20-05-2020 ##

ASX followed S&P 500’s rallies yesterday along with small pop today. S&P 500 experienced the orgy thanks to the exciting news from biotechnology company’s Moderna’s possible COVID-19.
Yet, both failed to break out the resistance level of 2960 and 5550 in this week, indicate looming prospects and conservative sentiment.  But with fundamentals apparently little changed, there’s been a lack of impetus for traders to turn overwhelmingly bullish on stock. With the normalisation of the oil price, energy sector stocks lead the rally, along with a rebound in financial sector and consumer discretionary sector stocks.
Conveying the severe impact social distancing measures had on consumption in April, the Retail Sales data showed there was no industry that saw a rise in retail turnover last month. True to recent form, the markets generally shrugged off the poor data, seemingly putting it in the “old news” basket.
Meanwhile, China imposed 80% tariff onto Australian barley exports for next five years and rejected to call back or put the deal back to the table, which might only be a start   

Currently, individual portfolios are already We want to make sure we have enough ammunition when outbreaks all clear out and further possible interest rate cut.

ASX200 suffers two consecutive loss in the row and resulting 0.38% lower, banks shared majority of the blames while some mid-caps/small caps showed strong resilient interim. Despite the rally in risk assets – due to surprisingly stronger trade balance sheet with China, fears and sentiment remain conservative and investors seem waiting for clearer picture ahead.


Rumour has the fed and global central banks are in the line to conduct more stimulus if concerns about depression extends future. However, primary question remains as how much ammunition they have left…  With already announced QE-to infinity program, if it proves insufficient, the next step for the fed will be to implement some new yield curve control program.

 

ASX 200 ‘s dynamics has manifested in a market that is stuck in a range and it is losing its momentum to break through its recent double top around 5500.

 

Research affirms arise of digital payment(transactions) amid this outbreak, suggesting that coronavirus is changing the way we pay.


## 29-04-2020 ## 

Market closed 1.51% higher with 5393.40 with risk appetite returned, in sympathy with broader Asian indices. Interestingly, ASX200 continues to underperform other global benchmark indices possibly due to stronger AUD/USD..   

Australian CPI data was the key event risk locally today, it generally surprised to the upside, with year-over-year price growth increasing by 2.2 per cent las quarter, up from 1.8 per cent in the previous quarter. With hoarding consumption for staple goods( including pizza, pasta ,toilet paper,etc) and triage demand, the abnormality is estimated to run into opposite way, resulting in greater deflationary in short term.

In terms of the market sentiments, market conditions cant be said to have been anything close to bearish however overnight US market appeared a touch of de-risking going on.

Meanwhile, It’s become US tech’s time to shine for this quarter’s US reporting season, while the advanced US GDP print along with a meeting of the US Federal Reserve tonight will be crucial in framing the macroeconomic landscape for market participants. Market looked through the figure and put bets on that “whatever it takes” tone from Fed in its policy statement.

**Weekly Market wrap / Forward looking:**

Stock indices have generally struggled to make new highs, and while certain asset classes that act as growth-proxies have held up reasonably well, there looks right now to be little impetus for market participants to take-on any additional risk.

A lack of (upside) headline risk will do that: though some piecemeal stimulus packages have been touted or announced this week, they pale in comparison to the absolute cannons fired by government and central banks throughout late-March and early April.

 On top of that, too, the sight of very rich valuations, as price climbs but earnings guidance falls in equity markets, ups the stakes of going long stocks, as things currently stand.

Given volatility is very high still by historical standards, if global markets were to be hit with some sort of negative surprise, it raises the risk of a retest of recent lows. Event risk is significant next week, meaning there’s no shortage of opportunities to see this come about. 

The corporate and economic calendar is stacked, with some of America’s biggest corporations, most notably in the tech-space delivering their earnings updates, and with the world’s three largest central banks, the US Fed, the ECB, and the BOJ, set to meet. 

**Weekly highlights / Wired:**

Oil futures went negative for the first time with West Texas Intermediate futures settling at negative $37.63. Speculators often buy oil futures to bet that the oil price will rise, then sell the futures before they expire and they’re required to take physical delivery of oil. In this case, few buyers emerged to buy those futures because the oil glut means storage tanks are mostly full, including in Cushing, Oklahoma where oil is delivered for these particular futures.

**Domestic Covid-19 update:**

Scott Morrison highlighted the automate contract tracing was no in the final stage of development and that rapid response measures were being bolstered to handle outbreaks.

However, China lockdown another city ‘Harbin’ due to silent carrier (one shows no symptoms) is identified and caused more than 78 cases. What happened in China reflected potential problem even when containment measure ease is implemented. Again, without effective vaccine in place we remain slightly bearish short term…  

Outside of the picture:

Interesting fact: Australia’s coronavirus tracing app’s data storage contract goes offshore to Amazon. With more than 30-40% worldwide drawdown, let’s take a look of Amazon’s share price.

**Sectors / Stocks of interests:**

Fear of missing out is fading out while valuation of valuation for the popular software companies remain hot amid covid-19. Xero,WiseTech and Altium recovered relatively quicker… 

For instance, WiseTech reaffirm their earning guidance, revenue growth, strong balance sheet, robust liquidity and cash generation ability / WiseTech also expect their business to remain resilient, as Covid - 19 will continue to adversely impact on many economies and global supply chain movements, highlighting the uncertainty around its supported logistic industry.

 However, demand for global technology, digital transformation and integrated platforms will continue to accelerate.


## 23-04-2020 ## 

ASX200 index dipped 4.2 points or 0.1 percent to 5217.1, market is now going sideways but seize slightly decreasing volatility. Followed by the rally of wall street (credit to normalized oil price), sentiments still remain fragile as investors concern potential ‘surprises’ from US quarterly earnings reports and upcoming interim reports from Australian banks.
Worth of noticing that, goods exports to China rebounded in March, witnessed a significant increments of 29% according to data released by ABS. 


Australia survived from 2007-2009 financial crisis under the help of China as boosting infrastructure construction and demand for mining back then. With slow recover and resume of China, I assume Australia will follow that pace.

## 22-04-2020 ## 

Market  closed ended the day at 5221.2 points, intraday it was down as much as 1.05% but slowly bounced back.

We down as much as 7% and touched 5100 bar in three days and sending caveat to investors that the volatility is incredibly high and turmoil is not where near finished. 

Although  we only have 4 cases confirmed in the past 24 hours, inevitable earning declines put lots of pressure on the rally has carried share prices off the lows recorded in March.

Keey eye on the PMI data tomrrow as investors expect to investigate the magnitude of the damage.

## 21-04-2020 ## 

Market records 2.5% lower two days in row, indicating market and investors’ fears. Oil act the accomplice to kick the rock off the rally and we are all tumbling in middle of the avalanche.

As solitary witnesses to the chaos that reigned, WTI oil futures put on the jaw dropped show where it went negative and down more than 300% within less than 2 hours. Meanwhile, Brent collapsed  followed a historic plunge in oil prices below zero for the first time ever. 

Investors may wondering why and how does that happen, before that we need understand what is the storage cost. Under normal conditions, the futures price is higher than the spot (or cash) price under the effect of the cost of carry. More specifically, it costs include interest expense, interest on loans and any storage cost. 

However, investors realize that containment measure ease is not coming anytime sooner while there is sluggish demand for oil. Most importantly, US is running out the place to storage all these oils while oil producers experience difficulty to dumping them into the sea like milk. Therefore, they are essentially paying you money to pull oil away.

THe avalanche send the caveat again to all investors and market participants “Uncertainty is the only certain thing”

This is a process where an insolvent company is placed in the hands of an independent person who can assess the best path forward for its business owner and creditors

Within next 28 days, Deloitte will sit with management team to figure out plan to pay their creditors in the most optimal way. At this time, Qantas looks very attractive unless we want to go back to travelling by boat.
