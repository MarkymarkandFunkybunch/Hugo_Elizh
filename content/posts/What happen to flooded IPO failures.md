What happen to flooded IPO failures 

## What just happened? ## 
Statistics from Refinitiv shows ASX only records 416million worth IPO in the first nine month, which is lowest since 2012. üìâ
To date, just $400 million over eight floats has been raised for companies including tracking app Life360 (ASX 360), which raised $145 million, non-bank lender Prospa(ASX PGL), which failed at its first run at the boards, and one of LICS, Investec Australia Property Fund(ASX,IAP).

## Why does it happened? ##

### Black-Box üïã ### 

Private valuation has become accepted yardstick for what those companies worth in public. PE and VC provides cash for equity in the firm, each new fundraising sets new valuation for the company. The valuation is usually set up by different factors including revenue market size and management.

 However, those process tend to **bias** toward higher prices because of private market. The problem is because private market is filled with almost exclusively by investors who want their investment to be appreciate. Private market valuation normally doesn‚Äôt subject to scepticism ü§î that is common in the public market. Private investors, also, constrained by their ability to sell their stake üí® in the company;


### Preference share ### 

One popular way of enticing investors is by offering them preference shares that offers perk above or beyond the ownership stake conferred by common stock. Meanwhile, those preference stocks are often sold to early run investors and are much valuable than the common stocks sold in the IPO. 

Preference share is valued at premium based on two features which called liquidation and ratchetÔºåguaranteeing investors can receive their original stake or receive additional shares if company does IPO at lower price. During the valuation class, those preference shares are valued equally to common stock, even they are not entitled to same payoff. Therefore, rational investors reluctant to pay full price for preference shares to receive common shares.  

### Accountant or Magician? üßô ###

Private accounting is not strictly subjected to the accounting standard that public companies must use. They are far freer to present investors with nonstandard data that paints a rosier picture of their financial health. We work as an unique example alone, tested investors with made up accounting metrics,‚Äù community adjusted EBITD, measures net income before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization but also building and community level operating expense, including tenancy expense, utilities internet and building staffs. 


Apart from macro factors, let‚Äôs investigate into a few failed IPOs and dig into the **‚Äòidiosyncratic‚Äô risk**
