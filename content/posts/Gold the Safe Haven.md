### <bold>Factors affect Gold price:</bold> ###

Gold is well know as the safe heaven asset . That is why gold price usually soars up whenever you see trade war uncertainty or intension between countries or instability of the world politics. The fear of market reaches the peak, so does gold. 

Gold has negative correlation with USD 
When the value of the US dollar falls against other currencies, this often promotes people to flock to security of gold then increase gold price. Large trade deficits and large increase of money supply.
As illustrated from below, gold price seems correlated negatively with USD. in other words, when USD increased, gold price decreases and vice versa.

Our view: Last week, Fed gave a hawkish cut of interest rate pushing the Fed fund rate down to range between 1.75% to 2.00%. Fed cut mainly because global economic conditions are weak and uncertain continues to weigh on growth given US Chinese trade war. In other words, foreseeable weakness of us dollar echoes our recommendation of purchasing gold at the moment.

### Geopolitician uncertainty ### 

Gold retains its value not only in terms of financial uncertainty but in terms of geopolitical uncertainty, it is often called crisis commodity, it often outperforms other investments. At the moment, US trade war and US Iran tension and Brexit could be catalyst for gold price boost.

Take Brexit as an example,
When Brexit raised on  23-06-2016  gold price jumped from 1248- 1313 in one day.

 Our view:  The probability of No - deal Brexit is had been steadily increasing following the Boris Johnson ‘s “do or die” promise to take the UK out of EU by 31 October and lack of and negation with the EU, which will create massive turmoil once it actions. From this point of view, demand and price of gold will increase tremendously with the accumulating fears.

Tension between US- China trade war:  On 01-Aug 2019, Trump announced the additional 10% tariff will be levied on the remaining $300 billion of goods and then Central bank of China let the renminbi fall over 2% in three days to the lowest point since 2008. As a result, the gold price reacted and increased significantly in several weeks

My view: That is also the reason why with increasing uncertainty of trade war and instability of the world increases the demand of gold. Without further resolution to any issues mentioned, gold is still considered as a good buy option. 

Negative interest rate & Yield curve inversion

The yield curve inversion just got more pronounced. Not only the spread between 10-year and 3-month Treasuries, now also the spread between 10-year and 2-year turned negative. Historically speaking, economic will enter recession stage when within12-22 months after it witness yield inversion.

Recessions means risk aversion and strengthen safe-haven demand for gold. In a response to an economic slump, the central bank is expected to provide a fresh monetary accommodation, slashing interest rates. Normally when interest rate increases, rising yield indicates strong economy and then led to inflation and money will flow into other fixed income investment. 

However, with negative interest environment, gold as a zero yield asset will look more attractive versus an asset that is guaranteed to lose money US market is at all time high and fears of market. Graphically, the price of gold positively correlates with negative yielding debt.

Although billionaire hedge fund founder Ray Dalio said in a linked that it would be both risk reducing and return enhancing to considering adding a gold to one’s portfolio in a negative yield environment

My view: Therefore, under worldwide negative interest environment and yield curve inversion, gold looks attractive than ever and it is recommended as ideal add in to your portfolio.

Be greedy  “for gold”  when others are fearful 

After the understanding of factors affect the gold, we want to further explains why we strongly recommend investors to look at gold.

Shadow of recession &  Worldwide Turbulence

Just at the beginning of this week, purchasing managers’ index (PMI) reports coming out of the European Union Monday showed the Euro zone composite PMI for September come in at a lower-than-expected 50.4. A reading below 50.0 suggests contraction. More worrisome, Germany’s manufacturing PMI in September came in at 41.4, which was also worse than expected and suggests the German economy is teetering on recession.  This echoes above mentioned worldwide recession and instability, purchasing gold will preserve the dollar value and hedge against black swan events.

Thus, there was more protesting and related violence in Hong Kong over the weekend, the U.S.-China trade negotiations have taken another step backward and there is mounting concern regarding weakening global economic growth. U.S.-Iran tensions are also smouldering in the background. All of the above making traders and investors around the globe extra nervous.

Last week, former Overstock CEO Patrick Byrne liquidated his position in his company and bought gold, silver and bitcoin to protect against a recession and the deep state. 
Byrne said his move to hard assets is a hedge against a "deteriorating world situation" and the "Deep State". 

Analyst views & Gold Future prices 

Also, according to a recent note by Citigroup’s analysts, the outlook for gold is quite healthy as they see a possibility of prices rallying to a record above $2,000 an ounce in the next two years. 

They quote we expect spot gold prices to trade stronger for longer, possibly breaching $2,000 an ounce and posting new cyclical highs at some point in the next year or two,” they said. If that level was reached, it would exceed the record of $1,921.17 set in 2011. 

The price of gold rallied today, closing up more than 1% to $1,531 per ounce and U.S. gold futures rose 1.1% to $1,532.40 an ounce.  That was its highest closing price in more than two weeks. 

Technical analysis & Buy point 

Gold price provided additional positive trades to achieve our first waited target at 1524.00 and attempts to confirm breaching it, reinforcing the expectations of continuing the bullish trend in the upcoming sessions, reminding you that our next target reaches 1555.00, while achieving it conditions holding above 1485.00. At this point we are looking at 1555 at the first place and further breakout afterwards.
Also, please keep in mind the pullback is healthy for the gold market. It is always a challenge to pinpoint highs or lows when a market is very volatile

Other Benefits of investing in gold

Including gold in your portfolio also provides investors with other benefits.

Hedge against inflation

inflation happens when currency loss and it loses power of purchasing to inflation, gold tends to be priced in. Gold is treated as good store of value so people may be encouraged to buy gold when they believe local currency is losing value. With low interest rate at the moment and high inflation predicted in the future, purchasing the gold will be an optimal option to hedge against inflation and preserve your dollar value.

Portfolio Diversification

The essence of portfolio diversification is finding various investment that are not closely correlated to one another, in other words, smaller beta. Gold has historically had a negative correlation to stocks and other financial instruments. Recent history bears this out:
•	The 1970s was great for gold, but terrible for stocks, 1980s and 1990s is exact opposite
•	2008 saw stocks drop substantially as consumers migrated to gold.
Properly diversified investors combine gold with stocks and bonds in a portfolio to reduce the overall volatility and risk.


Approaches to invest in Gold

With that said, there are several following ways to invest in Gold:

Physical Gold:

You could purchase physical gold and pay storage fee by yourself. In this case, you eliminate third party risk and it perfectly tracks the gold price compared to other investment like ETF introduced later.  

You should keep in mind that purchasing physical gold is considered as value preservation before your commit any money into physical good. As physical gold doesn’t suit for the strategy of buying in and sell out next day. Without market pressure, timeframe of bullion purchase is recommended to be set around 8-10 years and the biggest problem will be how you keep it safe. 


Another thing to keep in mind is even though gold can preserve its value but it doesn’t have ability to generate extra cash flow, for example interests for locking in term deposits, dividends for owing securities, coupons for owning bonds etc. 


Gold ETF: 

Based on the volatility of the gold price, investor usually invest in Gold ETF to gain exposure to gold  and its price movements. As ETFs Physical Gold fund provides investors with a return that is equivalent to movements in the gold spot price (less fees). 

Moreover, you will find some gold-backed ETFs that are leveraged, offering you two or even three times of gain and losses made by gold.  As mentioned, If you are feeling bearish about the ASX, it could be worth buying some shares in this ETF.  
There are three 100% Gold-bullion backed ETFs listed on the ASX: 

**BetaShares Gold Bullion ETF [ASX:QAU]**

**ANZ ETFS Physical Gold ETF Fund [ASX:ZGOL]**

**ETFS Metal Securities Australia Ltd [ASX:GOLD]**

However, one of the biggest drawbacks of Gold ETF is that you don’t actually own gold when buying a gold ETF.  You own the security instead and the security is in theory backed by the physical gold, owned by third party on your behalf.

Gold Mining Company 

Invest in gold mining company will be another but also least recommended option to gain some exposure to gold. As companies that producing gold can experience output fall or production cost increase which leads to increase of share prices. 

In short, you aren’t really making a gold investment when you buy shares in a gold mining company. Instead you are buying an ownership stake in a company that is in the business of finding gold and selling it to the market at a profit. To purchase a gold mining company. you will also be subject to other company specific risks, like management issue, accounting problems or even market risks.

### Conclusion ###

The US central bank has two more policy meetings for the year, in October and December, but there is no certainty it would cut rates further. Market puts odds of a rate cut in October at less than 50%, but forecasts another rate cut in December. 

Under shadow of worldwide recession and with uncertainties around several geopolitical events, we strongly recommend you add gold into your portfolio in order to not only preserve value but also to hedge against inflation and black swan events. Above discussed three investment approaches suit different investors with individual’s risk aptitude and investment horizon and we recommend you consult with financial professionals before you make your decisions.
