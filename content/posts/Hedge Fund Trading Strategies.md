As an ex-research analyst / market intelligent analyst, this section i want to run you through some most-deployed investing/trading strategies by Hedge Funds / Asset management firms 

## Hedge Fund Trading Strategies ## 

**Event Driven Strategies:** 

Event Driven Strategies seek to capitalise on opportunities arising during a company’s life cycle, trigger by extraordinary corporate events, such as spin-offs, mergers, acquisition, business combination, liquidations and restricting….

Under due diligence and statistical modelling, hedge fund scrutinize & assess the probability and forecast the timing of potential catalysts, including FDA approval, potential mergers ,Bank license grant etc…

Whenever we trade the stocks, we are actually trading the info as those catalysts lead stock prices go up or down. Track back to research deck, we normally analyse potential partnerships or negotiating M&A deals then bet against other fund managers. Once announcements made, that is when we sell our pre-filled order. On the street, so called buy the rumour but sell the fact.



**Systematic trading:**

Thoes strategies are designed by machine and are exeucted by algos, supported by massivce historical data analysis. According the statistics from Economists,e Medallion
fund, the flagship fund run by Renaissance
Technologies and set up by Jim Simons in
1988, was up by 24% in March. 

One of the biggest advantage of systematic trading relates to the diversificaiton, it could easily take several thousand positions,as opposed to human-based strategies generally have around 100.

The pandemic seems likely to pose the most financial danger to highly leveraged businesses—precisely the type of firm
that private-equity funds tend to invest in。 Private equity is accusomtised not to disclose their return, known as black box opeartion, however downgrade their returns by 20%. 

(To be continue...)

**Market Netural:**

A long/short equity strategy variation is the one used by equity market neutral funds characterized by holding a market neutral portfolio, i.e., its performance is not correlated to market
movements.

Even though they are close relatives, equity market neutral
funds differ from long/short equity funds for their systematic risk level. According to the LIPPER TASS database, on 31st December 2004, equity market neutral funds accounted for only 6% of the hedge fund industry.

During market uptrends, equity market neutral funds make a profit if long positions go up more rapidly than the drop in value incurred by the short positions in portfolio. Vice versa,
in market downtrends, they make a profit if short positions go up at a faster rate than the rate at which long positions are going down.

A beta adjusted net exposure close to zero is a target for every truly equity market neutral portfolio. Notwithstanding, an equity market neutral portfolio may have a beta adjusted net
exposure that is very close to zero, but its beta adjusted net exposure with regard to sectors or geographical areas will not be zero, and therefore it may be subject to specific risks,
like for example sector risks or country risks. 

This should not come as a surprise, because our common sense tells us that if we eliminate all systemic risks, we are also giving up performance. A truly equity market neutral portfolio must be very diversified (i.e. more than 100 equities) in order to be able to minimize the sector exposures and the country exposures.

Furthermore, every equity position should be hedged with another equity or a basket of equities of the same sector.
