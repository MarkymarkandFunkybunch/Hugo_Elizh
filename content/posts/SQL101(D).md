When you browse around jobs, did you often get this from desciption?

 ** proficient in sql" **

 Yea that was me in the past 5 years but never even curious enough to find out what it was.

First of all, SQL stands for structured query language

Query: is the request made to database management system for specific informaiton.
if the database becomes complex that difficult to get specific pieces of information we want.

We wrote sql statements to perform tasks such as update data and the databse, or to retrieve data from the databse.

no shortcut is the only shorcut. Like every language, we need to practice to hone our skills.  Websites below is the good practice

 Student Table:

create table Student(SId varchar(10),Sname varchar(10),Sage datetime,Ssex varchar(10));
insert into Student values('01' , 'Mike' , '1990-01-01', 'M' );
insert into Student values('02' , 'Jason' , '1990-12-21' , 'M');
insert into Student values('03' , 'Nick' , '1990-12-20' , 'M');
insert into Student values('04' , 'Chris' , '1990-12-06' , 'M');
insert into Student values('05' , 'Jessie' , '1991-12-01' , 'F');
insert into Student values('06' , 'Emma' , '1992-01-01' , 'F');
insert into Student values('07' , 'Olivia' , '1989-01-01' , 'F');
insert into Student values('09' , 'Ava' , '2017-12-20' , 'F');
insert into Student values('10' , 'Isabella' , '2017-12-25' , 'F');
