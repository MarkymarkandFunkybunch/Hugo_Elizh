## What is stock index? ## 


Stock market index is the measure of selection of stock market. Take ASX 200 as an example, it is a market -capitalisation weighted and float adjusted stock market of stocks listed on Australia securities exchange. In other words, this index includes top 200 largest and most liquid stocks in the Australia share market, which normally refers as the benchmark of the Australian equity performance.

## What is index rebalancing and why should index rebalanced regularly? ##


While, the index is regularly rebalanced to ensure index are liquid and tradeable. More specifically, ASX will re-assess top 200 stocks given on their liquidity and market capitalisation and replace one with another. Numerous investors curious about the impact of new stocks to be included in the index and wonder should they do index running? Today we want to give our investors quick tour about index running and its impact.


## Should investors consider index running? ## 
Index running known as simply buying the stocks they are added to index that passive manage funds are designated track, which is also known as order anticipation since traders senses the upcoming trades and their directions.

Why? Because fund manager of passive fund (index tracking fund) will subject to track those index return once it rebalances in order to minimise tracking errors. (* tracking error refers to the difference between the fund return and indexâ€™s return)

With that said, the day when stocks being added into the index will create massive volume to push share prices up since all passive fund managers have to buy those stocks to minimise their tracking errors right when stocks are added to the index. About the volumes, research revealed that the volume will shoot up till 50 times greater than average and fund managers must buy 10% of stock market capitalisation.

## Scent of blood? ## 

However, it will create higher trading costs as market participants knows those fund managers will jump in and buy. In this case, fund managers get in the dilemma or trade off between trading cost and expense of tracking error.

For this analysis, I examined all announced change to ASX 200 index from last 6 months (starting from March 2019 till Sep 2019). Below calculation shows stocks normally experienced a quick rise (due to artificially buy in from fund managers) and then more than 2/3 of them tanked. After analysis and test, optimal strategy might be to short on the trading day 1 and close your position at trading day 4 is considered to maximise your profits for index running. (details as below)

Although there is a room for trading for a spike, but it is small. Because, announcements for are made after the market close, and the stock price predictably increases sharply in afterhours trading in response to an announcement that the stock will be added. Unless you have a low latency algorithm.


## Summing up ## 

Overall speaking,  our recommendation is shorting those stocks at the day 1 when stocks are effectively added to index and then close on day 4 ,at that time research recommends that artificial pressure goes away and shares normally decline bit.
