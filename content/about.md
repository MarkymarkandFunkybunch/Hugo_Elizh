Hey there, welcome to the Super Marky, it is great to see you here.

I started this blog back in September 2019, initially it was designed to motivate me to introspect my own perception while now i hope it could be also acted as a curated to budge you to think differently & radically.

There are certain topics you might expect from this blog:

  * Trading / Investing
  * Data Science / Analytics
  * VC / Entrepreneurship
  * Fitness / Lifestyle 
  * Stand up Comedy
